# To Do List

A basic beginner to-do-list implemented with React

> This project was built using Development React and a local JSON server. 
## Setting it up: 
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project directory 
3. Type the following commands in two different terminal tabs<br>
```npm start```<br>
```npx json-server --watch ./src/data/database.json --port 8000```

> This will create a local development server with the To-Do-List running and connected to the local JSON database

<br>

<small>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).</small>
